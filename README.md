# spectre.methodology

## Description
Repository for methods used in creating SPECTRE, a novel set of standardized, high-resolution global raster layers, each a potential threat to endangered species.

Check out SPECTRE at [LIBRe](https://biodiversityresearch.org/spectre/). There you can find a handy dashboard allowing for quick visualization of each layers and instructions on alternative ways of accessing SPECTRE, such as through [Paituli](https://paituli.csc.fi/). You can also check a versioned history of SPECTRE at Zenodo.
